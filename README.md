## 💡 Summary of Key Generic Concepts Learned

This code uses C\# Generics to create type-safe, reusable, and high-performance classes, primarily demonstrated through the implementation of a Zoo Management system. All explanatory inline commands were generated by the AI assistant, Gemini, to help break down the core concepts.

| Concept | File Location | How It's Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Basic Generics** | `Stack<T>` | Eliminates `object` usage, enforcing **Type Safety** (compile-time checking) and **Performance** (avoiding boxing/unboxing). |
| **Class Constraint** | `AnimalPen<T>` | `where T : Animal` forces the generic type to be the `Animal` class or any of its derived classes (`Bear`, `Camel`). |
| **Interface Constraint** | `ZooFeeder.Feed<T>` | The method requires the parameter to implement `IPoppable<T>`, making the method extremely reusable for any stack-like structure. |
| **Covariance** (`out`) | `IPoppable<out T>` | Allows generic types to be used **more specifically** (e.g., use an `IPoppable<Bear>` where an `IPoppable<Animal>` is expected for output). |
| **Contravariance** (`in`) | `IPushable<in T>` | Allows generic types to be used **more generally** (e.g., use an `IPushable<Animal>` where an `IPushable<Bear>` is expected for input). |
